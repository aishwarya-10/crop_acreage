# Crop Acreage
Remote sensing techniques help in estimating the magnitude of cropland planted with a crop. Crop area statistics are produced with crop acreage methodologies.

**Data:** Optical/Microwave (Peak growth stage imagery)

**Methodology:**
Crop pixels generated from crop classification represent cropped land. Crop area is calculated by multiplying pixels by image resolution.
